# Ramsar site

Assam, a state in northeastern India, is known for its rich biodiversity and natural beauty. It is home to several Ramsar sites, which are wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention. Here are some Ramsar sites in Assam:

1. Deepor Beel Wildlife Sanctuary: Located near Guwahati, the capital city of Assam, Deepor Beel is a freshwater lake and wetland of great ecological significance. It is recognized as a Ramsar site due to its role in supporting a wide variety of resident and migratory waterbirds, including several endangered species.
2. Chandubi Lake: Situated in Kamrup district of Assam, Chandubi Lake is another Ramsar site known for its diverse bird population and scenic beauty. It is surrounded by lush green hills and serves as a vital habitat for both resident and migratory bird species.
3. Son Beel: Son Beel, located in Karimganj district of Assam, is the largest freshwater lake in the state. It is recognized as a Ramsar site due to its ecological importance and the presence of unique aquatic vegetation. The lake is known for its scenic beauty and the traditional fishing practices of the local communities.
4. Dibru-Saikhowa National Park: Although not entirely a Ramsar site, the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, situated in Tinsukia district, encompasses several wetland areas that are part of the larger Brahmaputra River floodplains. The park is renowned for its rich biodiversity, including the critically endangered white-winged wood duck and numerous migratory bird species.

These Ramsar sites in Assam play a crucial role in supporting the region's biodiversity, conserving wetland ecosystems, and providing habitats for various plant and animal species. They also contribute to the local economy through nature tourism and sustainable livelihoods for nearby communities.
